==============================

RELEASE DATE
------------

October 2016

LIST OF CHANGES
---------------

### IKOS Core Changes

* Added an abstract domain to handle C++ exceptions.

### Analyzer Changes

* Implemented a proper C++ exception propagation handling using abstract interpretation. IKOS correctly handles C++ code with exceptions.
* Improved the analysis of string-related functions (such as strlen, strcpy and strcat).
* Fixed the precision of the null dereference analysis.

### ARBOS Changes

* Removed AR_Unwind as it is no longer generated by LLVM since LLVM 3.1
* Added APIs to set and retrieve the "resume" basic block in an AR_Code.

================================

RELEASE DATE
------------

September 2016

LIST OF CHANGES
---------------

### IKOS Core Changes

* Added interfaces for abstract domains, nullity domains, uninitialized variables domains, pointer domains and memory domains.
* Moved the pointer domain, the value domain and the summary domain under IKOS core.

### Analyzer Changes

* Added a pass to unify exit nodes.

### ARBOS Changes

* Added APIs to set and retrieve "unreachable" and "unwind" basic blocks in an AR_Code


IKOS VERSION 1.1.1 RELEASE NOTES
================================

RELEASE DATE
------------

August 2016

LIST OF CHANGES
---------------

### Analyzer Changes

* Added a pass `branching-opt` to optimize all Control Flow Graphs of the AR, before the analysis. The pass detects unreachable paths in the graphs and removes them.

### IKOS Core Changes

* Improved the precision of the interval domain on most binary operators.
* Added a wrapper for APRON.

### Other Changes

* Improved the bootstrap script. It is now able to build and install zlib, ncurses, libedit, GMP, SQLite and Python.
* Added installation instructions for Archlinux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Mac OS X, Red Hat and Ubuntu.
* Added support for gcc 4.9.2 and boost 1.55.0.


IKOS VERSION 1.1.0 RELEASE NOTES
================================

RELEASE DATE
------------

June 2016

LIST OF CHANGES
---------------

### Analyzer Changes

* Added the ability to demangle C++ function names.
* We now handle `calloc()` correctly. In IKOS 1.0.0, the function call was just ignored.
* Added the runtime options `--display-invariants` and `--display-checks`.
* Added a column called `column` to the result tables in the output database, containing the column number in the source code.
* Added a column called `stmt_uid` to the result tables in the output database, containing the UID of the checked statement.
* Performance improvement (the analysis is 70% faster in average).
* Bug fixes.

### LLVM Frontend Changes

The LLVM frontend now supports both LLVM 3.7 and 3.8.

### ARBOS Changes

ARBOS now gives the column number in addition to the line number in `AR_Source_Location`.

### LLVM Frontend Changes

In this release we upgraded our LLVM frontend from version 2.9 to 3.7.

To have a C/C++ program fully represented in AR, there are several code transformation we had to handle with the frontend's intermediate representation. When using the LLVM framework as the frontend, we transform the following LLVM instructions so they can be expressed in AR:

* `phi` instruction
* `getelementptr` instruction
* `insertvalue` and `extractvalue` instructions
* `i/fcmp` and `select` instructions
* removed `br`
* `constantexpr` and its subclasses
* translation of intrinsic calls to AR-supported intrinsic calls. We currently support `memset`, `memcpy`, `memmove`, `vastart`, `vaend`, `va_arg`, and `vacopy`.

In the previous release v0.0.1 we handled all transformation in **ARBOS**. The previous tool chain architecture defined another intermediate representation, called **AIR**, that served as a direct translation from the LLVM bitcode to an S-expression format that was fed into **ARBOS**. **ARBOS** then parsed and transformed **AIR** to **AR** in memory.

This release removes **AIR** entirely. All transformation are done in **LLVMAR**, while **ABROS** only parses the AR and makes it available in memory for ARBOS analysis plugins to traverse and perform analysis on it.

### ARBOS API Changes

* Each `AR_Global_Variable` may contain an initializer represented as `AR_Code`. In the previous release we dedicated an initializer function for each global variable. These initializer functions were individually invoked in `main()`. In this release, analyzers need to dive into the initializer of an `AR_Global_Variable` to analyze the initializer code.
* Differentiates between store vs. real sizes of an `AR_Type`.
* Supports `varags` intrinsic calls in the AR. This was not supported in the previous release.
* Function pointers are now available in the AR model; they were misinterpreted and were not available in the previous release.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

Source Code Fortification
-------------------------

Source code fortification aims at making your source code more robust. It replaces regular `memset()`, `memcpy()` and `memmove()` calls to `__memset_chk()`, `__memcpy_chk()` and `__memmove_chk()`. According to Linux Standard Base Core Specification 4.1, the interfaces `__memset_chk()`, `__memcpy_chk()` and `__memmove_chk()` shall function in the same way as the interface `memset()`, `memcpy()` and `memmove()`, respectively, except that `__memset_chk()`, `__memcpy_chk()` and `__memmove_chk()` shall check for buffer overflow before computing a result. If an overflow is anticipated, the function shall abort and the program calling it shall exit.

The Buffer Overflow Analysis (BOA) in IKOS handles `__memset_chk()`, `__memcpy_chk()` and `__memmove_chk()` as unknown library functions, and won't report any warning. Consider using `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0` when you compile your source code to LLVM bitcode manually.

Handling Global Variables
-------------------------

Prior to performing any analysis, the initialization code of the global variables in the AR program model are inlined in function `main()` if available. This transformation of the AR program model is implemented as an AR pass located at `analyzer/src/ar-passes/inline-init-gv.cpp`.

LLVM Frontend Limitation
------------------------

The current implementation of LLVM frontend does not support LLVM vector type (http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#vector-type).

Octagon Abstract Domain
-----------------------

The octagon abstract domain has some implementation issues. Do not use it.

Variable Length Array
---------------------

IKOS is unsound if you have a variable length array in your code. A variable length array, or [VLA](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variable-Length.html), is a stack allocated array with a dynamic size. For instance:

```
void f(int size) {
  int tab[size]; // VLA, allowed in ISO C99
  ...
}
```

Functions with Variable Arguments
---------------------------------

IKOS is unsound if you have a function that takes a variable number of arguments (using `va_list`) that also has side effects (for instance, the function updates a global variable or the content of one of its pointer argument). In such situation, IKOS might terminate unexpectedly.
